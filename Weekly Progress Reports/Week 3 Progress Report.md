|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Jessica Becerra | 5 | -Provided Frustration Report <br> - Downloaded the data files from World Bank | My biggest challenge this week was getting the data properly download to my computer and also previewing it to make sure that everything that needed to be in it was included. Also SQL lite was not working well for me on my mac and trying to upload the data into there was difficult. |
| Ashley Cortez | 10 hours |-Provided Frustration Report <br> - Uploaded data to SQLite <br> - Created indicator tables as outlined in ERD <br> -Verified functionality of database <br> - Uploaded database and SQL queries to Github <br> - Created Weekly Progress Report <br> - Proposed timeline for this week's deliverables | My biggest challenge this week was determining the best approach for loading the data into SQLite. There were many transformations needed given that the raw data from the World DataBank is not in an ideal format initially. There was also a bit of a learning curve for navigating SQLite on a Mac, however I found it was most straightforward to use via the DB Browser UI download for SQLite |
| Robert Pimentel | 4 hours | -Provided Frustration Report <br> - Downloaded Data Files From World Bank|The Challenges I faced this week was downloading the correct information form the databases. The one database that was quite frustrating was the Statistical Indicators database and trying to find the right trade and macro economics indicatiors. Also attempting to use SQLite was a bit frustrating but after watching some quick videos online it became easier.  |
| Angelica Verduzco | 5 hours | -Provided Frustration Report <br> - Created new ERD <br> - Downloaded data files from World Bank | My challenge this week was ensuring I downloaded the data with necessary information. I also found it difficult to get started on SQLite and knowing if we could only use SQLite for the databases. This was my greatest challenge this week since I am not familiar with SQLite, attempting to upload the data into SQLite was also part of the challenge.  |
