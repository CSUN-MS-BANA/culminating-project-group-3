### 2. Individual Contributions
| **Student Name**  | **Time Spent (hrs)** | **Tasks Completed** | **Challenges Faced** |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Jessica Becerra | 8 hours | - Completed preprocessing for public_debt_indicators table <br> - Completed Frustration report based on Week 3| The main challege I was faced with this week was standerdizing the data and taking care of the many missing values in my data set. I also needed to convert some of the data, such as the Year column to categorical data, so that when displayed in a visualization it would make more sense.|
| Ashley Cortez | 9 hours | - Complete preprocessing for environmental_indicators table <br> - Complete preprocessing for statistical_indicators table <br> - Complete Frustration report based on Week 3 <br> - Create initial draft of Week 4 Progress Report| The main challenge I faced this week was taking the time to fully comprehend each indicator and its unit of measure. It was important to have and understand this context in order to accurately identify outliers within each table. It was also difficult to determine how to start preprocessing; we ended last week with our database in SQLite, however I personally found it easiest to conduct a descriptive analysis and preprocessing steps using Python within Google Colab. |
| Robert Pimentel | 8 hours |- Completed preprocessing for the Social_indicators table <br> - Completed Frustration report for week 3 | The main challeneged I faced this week was normaliziing specific social attributes. I had difficulty trying to normalize the distribution/fix the skewness but the multiple techniques I tried did help as much. |
| Angelica Verduzco | 8 hours |- Completed preprocessing steps for Economic_indicators table <br> -Completed Frustration report on Week 3 | The main challenge I faced this week was normalizing the different economic attributes. I had difficulty normalizing some attributes even after attempting different normalization techniques|
